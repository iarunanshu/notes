### **Spring Boot Exception Handling | Notes**

#### **Overview**
1. Exception handling is a highly important and frequently asked topic in interviews.
2. Spring Boot offers a structured mechanism to handle exceptions using classes, interfaces, and annotations.

---

### **Key Components**
1. **Dispatcherservlet**:
    - First component in the flow.
    - Invokes the controller (or may fail to do so, triggering an exception).

2. **HandlerExceptionResolver Interface**:
    - A key interface in exception handling.
    - Exposes the method `doResolveException`.

3. **Composite Exception Resolver**:
    - Acts as an orchestrator.
    - Delegates exceptions sequentially to three resolvers:
        - ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver
        - ResponseStatusExceptionResolver
        - DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver
    - Stops passing error once a resolver handles it.

4. **DefaultErrorAttributes Class**:
    - Creates the response for the client.
    - Sets attributes like timestamp, status, message, etc.
    - Always involved in creating the response regardless of whether exceptions are handled.

---

### **Classes and Flow**
1. **Classes Involved in Exception Handling**:
    - ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver (1)
    - ResponseStatusExceptionResolver (2)
    - DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver (3)
    - HandlerExceptionResolverComposite (Orchestrator/Helper) (4)
    - DefaultErrorAttributes (Defines output attributes) (5)

2. **Exception Flow**:
    - Exception occurs in the controller or Dispatcherservlet fails.
    - Exception flows sequentially through resolvers:
        1. **ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver**:
            - Handles @ExceptionHandler and @ControllerAdvice annotations.
        2. **ResponseStatusExceptionResolver**:
            - Handles uncaught exceptions annotated with @ResponseStatus.
        3. **DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver**:
            - Handles predefined exceptions (e.g., method not found, resource not found).
    - After resolvers, DefaultErrorAttributes is always invoked to set the response details.
    - Response returned to the client with appropriate attributes.

---

### **Key Concepts and Patterns**
#### **Exception Handling Approaches**:
1. **Controller-Level Exception Handling**:
    - Use @ExceptionHandler annotation in individual controllers.
    - Can handle single or multiple exceptions.
    - Allows creation of custom responses using `ResponseEntity`.

2. **Global Exception Handling**:
    - Use @ControllerAdvice to create a global handler for exceptions across multiple controllers.
    - Provides a central place for exception logic, reducing code duplication.
    - Controller-level handlers take precedence over global handlers.

#### **ResponseEntity vs. Default Attributes**:
- If **ResponseEntity** is returned in the handler, the framework stops further processing and does not involve DefaultErrorAttributes.
- If you only set response attributes without `ResponseEntity`, DefaultErrorAttributes is responsible for creating the final response.

#### **Custom Exceptions**:
1. Create custom exceptions (by extending `RuntimeException`) with fields for status and message.
2. Use them in controllers, handlers, or globally, with proper annotations.

---

#### **Resolvers Explained**
1. **ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver**:
    - Handles:
        - @ExceptionHandler annotations: Method-level exception handling in controllers.
        - @ControllerAdvice annotations: Global exception handlers.
    - Supports parameters like `HttpServletRequest`, `HttpServletResponse`, and the exception itself.
    - Resolves exceptions locally or globally.

2. **ResponseStatusExceptionResolver**:
    - Handles uncaught exceptions annotated with @ResponseStatus (e.g., HTTP status, reason).
    - Sets HTTP response status and an optional reason message.
    - Does not create a `ResponseEntity`—relies on DefaultErrorAttributes.

3. **DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver**:
    - Handles predefined or framework-related exceptions (e.g., "Method not found", "Resource not available").
    - Basic default resolver invoked last.

---

### **Edge Cases and Best Practices**
1. **Setting Response in Exception Handler**:
    - Use `ResponseEntity` for full control and to avoid dependency on DefaultErrorAttributes.
    - If using `response.sendError`, it commits the response, potentially causing issues when combined with @ResponseStatus.

2. **Combining @ExceptionHandler and @ResponseStatus**:
    - Mixed usage can lead to confusion.
    - Spring Framework (not ResponseStatusExceptionResolver) overrides method-defined status/message with @ResponseStatus values.

3. **Response Committing Pitfalls**:
    - Once a response is committed using `response.sendError`, further modification leads to server errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).

---

### **Practical Examples**
1. **Simple Controller with Custom Exception**:
    - Controller throws a `NullPointerException`.
    - Default flow sets HTTP 500, timestamp, and message.

2. **Using @ExceptionHandler**:
    - Handle exceptions locally within the controller using @ExceptionHandler methods.
    - Example: Return a custom JSON response with status, message, and timestamp.

3. **Using @ControllerAdvice**:
    - Handle exceptions across multiple controllers globally with @ControllerAdvice.
    - Reduces code duplication for large applications.

4. **Default Attributes Example**:
    - When no resolver handles the exception:
        - DefaultErrorAttributes sets HTTP 500 by default.

5. **ResponseStatusExceptionResolver**:
    - Example: Annotate custom exception class with @ResponseStatus.
    - Handles uncaught exceptions and sets status/reason.

6. **DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver**:
    - Handles framework-related exceptions (e.g., "Resource not found").
    - Example: A non-existing API call results in 404.

---

### **Best Practices**
1. Avoid mixing @ResponseStatus with @ExceptionHandler without clear logic.
2. Use `ResponseEntity` explicitly for predictable responses.
3. For large applications, prefer @ControllerAdvice for global exception handling to avoid duplication.
4. Understand resolver limitations and their flow (exception resolution sequence matters).

---

### **Important Debugging Tips**
1. Use breakpoints in HandlerExceptionResolverComposite to understand resolver iteration.
2. Examine DefaultErrorAttributes when exceptions aren’t explicitly handled.
3. Check for committed responses when combining `response.sendError` and @ResponseStatus.
